Problem : Find multiples of 3 and 5, then add them together.

Reflection
- had to use the modulus operator(%) to find multiples of 3 and 5
- had to use a 'for' loop to iterate all the way up to 1000
- create 'if' statement inside loop and
- then needed to assign(add) these values to a variable with the use of an assignment operator(+=) if the boolean of the iteration were to be true..
